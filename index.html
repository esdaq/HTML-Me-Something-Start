            JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich for the Netscape browser with the hopes of making basic HTML pages interactive.
            Before 1995, web pages were mostly text based with limited formatting.
            At the time web pages were mainly used to serve static content from educational institutions and forward-thinking businesses.
            JavaScript then called &quot LiveScript &quot made a splash in Netscape Navigator 2.0 which inspired a new wave of web interactivity.
            JavaScript quickly became a browser standard and introduced new scripting capabilities such as: form validation,
            DOM manipulation, basic event handling and interacting with the browser.

            Fast forward to 2024, JavaScript is the leading programming language that is not only used to script web pages but to also to develop
             full blown applications for a range of platforms and environments. According to Stackoverflow's Developer survey, over 65% of professional
              developers use JavaScript. Over 42% of professional developers are using Node.JS which is a JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
               Node.js is what allows developers to write server-side code which has paved the way for frameworks such as Express.js and NestJS.

            I started playing around with JavaScript in early 2022, and I've been able to make my own web app using JavaScript in react.
             React takes JavaScript further by extending it with JSX which allows developers to define HTML in a JavaScript file.
              You can create all kinds of react components that can be reused all throughout your app.
